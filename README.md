# AoC-2024
Pritons solutions to the Advent of Code 2024.

## Languages
I will use whatever languages I feel like at any given day.
Tho it will narrow down to:

- C
- C++
- Rust
- Python

The purpose of this is to challange myself and keep fit in my languages so I will alternate between them.

## Upload
Well in the event someone follows this actively I will upload my solutions one day behind the release of each challenge.
Except for day 1 cause I already commited that one and am too lazy to rebase it.

## Comments
- Day 1
  - I forgot there is a task 2 lol
  - I tried to optimize task 2 so much... but no use without a hashmap. I will just keep the current thing. Its slower but looks cooler.
- Day 2
  - Task 1 easy
  - Task 2 OMG FUCK THIS. Lots of edge cases. EDIT: Not as bad as day 3.
- Day 3
  - I wanted to do this one in Rust but Rust has no support for ASCII Strings as I found out debating with Xelph. Gonna be using C++ for this one.
  - Yes I know I could just have used Regex. My hope is that this is faster. Idk if it is and I am so tired that I do not care.
  - I hate this day. It took me like 4h. Probably more. I settled on using string search instead of trying to find do() and dont() in the same way I find mult. It just didnt work and I was loosing my sanity.
