# AoC-2024
Pritons solutions to the Advent of Code 2024.

## Languages
I will use whatever languages I feel like at any given day.
Tho it will narrow down to:

- C
- C++
- Rust
- Python

The purpose of this is to challange myself and keep fit in my languages so I will alternate between them.

## Upload
Well in the event someone follows this actively I will upload my solutions one day behind the release of each challenge.
Except for day 1 cause I already commited that one and am too lazy to rebase it.
